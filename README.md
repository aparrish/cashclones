# Cash Clones, or Contrary Bot

by [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)

Was a Twitter bot ([@cashclones](http://twitter.com/cashclones)) that satirizes
the character of Eli Cash in Wes Anderson's classic, The Royal Tenenbaums. Is
now a Twitter bot ([@contrarybot](http://twitter.com/contrarybot)) that
produces alternate histories, conspiracy theories, and just in general weird
contrarianism. (Changes suggested in personal correspondence with Leonard
Richardson.)

Uses [DBpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) to generate alternate history
ideas.
